## Nebula

The place where the ClojureVerse is forged.

Nebula is an effort to make various Clojure community services like:
- https://github.com/clojureverse/clojurians-log-app
- https://clojureverse.org/

find a more robust, scale-able and more importantly a community driven and maintained platform.

Powered by [Exoscale](https://www.exoscale.com/).

The apps are arranged by directory and their respective setup and READMEs can be found in them.
